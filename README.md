# statistical_data_analysis_2

This project is for an online store that sells video games from all around the world. I'll use data containing user and expert reviews of games, genres, platforms (eg Xbox or PlayStation), and historical game sales data available from open sources in 2016. I'll identify the patterns that determine a game's success or failure. With that in mind, I'll find the most potential game and plan advertising campaigns in 2017.
